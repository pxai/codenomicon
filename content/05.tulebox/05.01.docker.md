## Docker {#docker}
Docker is a linux-based container running framework, where container can be
any program configured to run in this environment.

### Docker machine
To install them you should run:

```shell
docker-machine create -d virtualbox dev
```
### Docker images
They are like VM snapshots, once they are built they are immutable, the files
do not change.

They are built in layers, where each layer is immutable. Each layers has his own ID,
a SHA with each layer, image Is too. Layers are created with every RUN command in
the Dockerfile file.

This way if images share layers based on the id, they will use the same. Only
last layer of each image is mutable, for example between debian and mongodb image.

```shell
docker images
```
Full tag names:
registry.hub.docker/mongo:latest
 Registry          / Imagename : Tag
```shell
docker-machine create -d virtualbox dev
```

```shell
docker logs -f image-id

```


```shell

```


```shell

```
### Keep things tidy
Be carefull or docker will fill up your system with containers, images and volumes.

Kill all running containers
```shell
docker kill $(docker ps -q)
```

Remove all stopped docker containers
```shell
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```

Delete one images

```shell
docker  rmi image-name
```

Delete all untagged
```shell
```
docker rmi $(docker images -q -f dangling=true)

Delete all images
```shell
docker rmi $(docker images -q)
```
Remove dangling volumes
```shell
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -f dangling=true -q)
```
```

```shell

```

```shell

```
