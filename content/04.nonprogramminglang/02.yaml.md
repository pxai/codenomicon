# YAML {#yaml}
YAML is a widely language, mainly for configuration purposes. It does not use any kind of delimiters as in xml or json, just tabs or spaces. Thanks to that, you can build hierarchies in configurations, nested structures, arrays, etc. with very clear and readable files.

This sample summarizes most of the options available
