## Json {#json}
JSON stands for JavaScript Object notation, is one of the most successful format for data exchange. More readable and lightweight than XML, it integrates with JavaScript naturally, but it can be used with any other language. It is, indeed, the languge of choice for REST apis, so

### Empty
empty object
```
{}
```
### Hello World
Normally is a key:value pair, enclosed with double quotes.
```
{ "greet": "Hello Json" }
```
You mus use commas to separate different fields.
```
{ 
    "name": "H.P. Lovecraft",
    "country" : "USA",
    "city" : "Dunwich" 
}
```
Composition is obvious:
{
    "name" : "H.P. Lovecraft",
    "origin" : {
        "country" : "USA",
        "city" : "Dunwich" 
    }
}

### Data types
Strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and objects.

Strings and numbers:
{
    "name" : "H.P. Lovecraft",
    "diedAtTheAgeOf" : 46,
    "height" : 1.89,
    "friends" : -42,
    "isNerd": true,
    "isBlack": false
}

Arrays in Json. They could be arrays of objects as well
{
       "name" : "H.P. Lovecraft",
       "tales" : [ "In the mountains of madness","The call of Cthulhu", "Dunwich's Horror" ]
}

Objects inside objects and arrays and objects...

{
       "name" : "H.P. Lovecraft",
       "books" : [ 
                    {"title":"At the mountains of madness", "publishedIn" :1936 },
                    {"title":"The call of Cthulhu", "publishedIn" : 1926}, 
                    {"title":"Dunwich's Horror", "publishedIn" : 1928} 
                ]
            "origin" : {
        "country" : "USA",
        "city" : "Dunwich"
