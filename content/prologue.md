# Prologue
##  The programmers black book
Every journey begins with a single step, but

_Abandon all hope, ye who enter here_

## Fly you fool
¿So, you want to start a career as a programmer? Are you sure? You are in time to step back before it’s too late.Upon you lies a twisted path with traps and obstacles along the way, aparently light but dark and full of terrors as a night without moon.
There are many ways in the labyrinth for you to choose. What about the way of the enterprise programmer? Databases, infinite forms, input validation, formatted output and absolute boredom. There is also the web ecosystem, the nightmarish ever-evolving frontend and the shape-shifting backend that creeps from a hardisk to containers or even to the serverless no-man-land. Or why not to try the mobile development, the ultimate mutating unnamable terror that lurks in everyone hands, mesmerizing their owners with neverending notifications.
Other corridors await behind new doors that came out of nowhere: iot, wereables, big-data, deep learning, blockchain, you name it. Coders may not be aware, but they’ve achieved their ultimate goal: to take over the world. Sounds pretentious? Just think a little bit, and imagine how many of your day by day routines are transferring data up and down, through systems that some programmer has created.

## Let me tell you a little secret
Computers are stupid. They may have incredible capabilities for processing millions of instructions and processing data, transform streams of 0s and 1s into images, emails, music and information,… but, ultimately, computers do what they are told to.
Even smartphones, despite of their fancy name are dumb piece of machinery. They also need instructions to run or they are just useless. And what are those instructions? Programs. And programs are written by programmers.
There are different kind on languages to give instruction for a computer. They all try to look like a natural language and before they are executed, the computer translates these programs to something it can deal with. Sometimes creating a different file (compilation) and sometimes translating on the fly (interpretation).
So, a program is a set of instructions for the computer to do some task. They normaly have an input, they process that following the instructions and finally they give an output or a result. And normally, a program solves a given problem, ranging from simple actions to complex operations.
Depending on the complexity of the problem thay need to solve, programs may (must) be organized in different components working together. And good programmers know how to organize this components to make them work together (cohesion, good) without overlapping their duties (coupling, bad). Once you learn the basics, you should follow the way of the software cratfsmen and try not only to solve problems, but also produce quality software, clean and maintanable.

## Ready
Every journey starts with a footstep, and the HelloWorld is the traditional ritual to be initiated when you learn a new programming language. This ceremony consists in setting any given development environment and being able to show the well-known “Hello World” on screen. That is the first step to gain confidence from the very begining. Here we will provide many options, if you are not able to get a Hello World with any of these, man, you better run and don’t look back, abandon all hope of make a living of this. You life will be much happier and your nerd friends, with a bit of luck, will show some mercy.

### Online programming
Righ now there are a plethora of websites and apps offering you online environments to learn programming and write and run programs. You don’t need to install anything, you just need to have a web browser and oops, Internet connection.

### Install a IDE
So, you don’t like to depend on the Internet? I hope that you can get connected for a while to download anything.
Last options
Well, and your last option is to use some of these. But all of them are a real pain in the ass for a beginner, and most are tough languages with non-existent editors.

- 1. The developer console of a Web Browser, for JavaScript
- 2. Any console:
  - 1. Windows + cmd: for batch “language”
  - 2. Windows + powershell: por powershell language
  - 3. Unix-like, Mac shell: bash or any similar scripting language
  - 4. Consider throwing away your computer before you try any of those

##Steady?
Open a browser go to https://repl.it and choose Ruby from the list. Or go directly to https://repl.it/languages/ruby You will see something like this:
There are two panels in this page:
- 1. On the left is were you will write your code. The editor highlights the words to help you while you write your programs.
- 2. On the right is where you see the result  of your code when you click on the “play” button.

This site has many other options, the one you should care about is to signup for a better management of your code. You will also be able to have your nickname in your creations.

## Hello World
Write this in the editor

```ruby
puts “Hello World”
```
And now press play.

This is what you’ll get:

Congratulations! You were able to write a correct program. Not a killer app though.
Data
Computer engineering, in abstraction, is the discipline of the transformation of data. Data, values, information, that is the center of the computer universe. Data is the primary good that a program must manage,  sometimes as raw material, others encoded for other programs and often formatted data ready for human consume.
In order to transform data, a program needs the means to hold it, and most common way to do it is using variables. Variables are containers capable of saving data. In our programs we can define variables where we can store, change and retrieve this data. The typical types of data are:
1. Numbers, with or without sign, with decimals, with different base, etc.
2. Strings, letters, or single characters
3. Booleans, variables that can only hold two values: true or false
4. Null, no data at all

## Ask for data
## Math
## True or false
## Crossroads
## Round, round the garden
## Divite et Vinci
